# 👋 Hi, I'm **Nicolas Bailly**
**Master of Bioinformatics (MBInf) Student | Bioinformatics & Computational Biology**

I’m a graduate student focused on developing reproducible, data-driven workflows for genomics, ecological modeling, and computational biology. I enjoy building pipelines, exploring genomic datasets, and applying machine learning to real-world biological problems.

---

## 📈 **Trajectory**
My earlier projects are primarily R-based, reflecting my statistical training, while my current work emphasizes Python for scalable and reproducible genomics pipelines.

## 🌱 **Projects**  

**Most Recent Project: DNA Barcode Quality Control Pipeline (Python)**  
Provides a fully dynamic and reusable workflow to perform quality control and generate summary metrics of DNA sequences. Filters ambiguous, short, or duplicate sequences, produces removal and metrics reports, and visualizes sequence length, GC content, and removal reasons.  

**Current Project: Genomics Data Analysis with SQL (Python)**  
Developing a Python-based genomics data analysis workflow using SQL to manage, query, and integrate large biodiversity datasets, enabling efficient exploration of sequence metadata, species variation, and downstream analyses.
